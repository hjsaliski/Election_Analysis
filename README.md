# Election_Analysis
python analysis

**Overview of Election Audit**:

The purpose of this election audit analysis was to take a file in the format of a CSV (comma seperated value), open it through python and answer questions based on the data through the use of repetition statements, conditionals, logical operators, and print statements. Through the module we found the number of total votes for the election, the number and percentage of votes for each candidate and the winning candidate with those respectable traits. For the challenege we were to find the total votes for each county, percentage of each of those votes and the county with the highest turnout in the same manner. We then wanted to express these values and format them into a text file to which they could be easily read and analyzed. 

**Election-Audit Results**:

-There was a total of 369,711 votes for this election. 
-We can see in this analysis that out of the three counties that are affiliated with the election, Denver had the largest turn out. Having 306,055 total votes, most of the votes came from the Denver district with 82.8% of the total votes being in this county. Jefferson county came in second place holding about 10.5% of the total votes for a count of 38,855 total votes. And Arapahoe contained 6.7% of the total votes with only 24,801 votes in this county. 
-Denver County had the largest number of votes at 306,055 containing 82.8% of the total votes
-From the analysis we can see that the first candidate Charles Stickham was given 85,213 votes, about 23% of the total votes given. Diana DeGette was given 272,892 votes accounting for 73.8% of the total votes. And Raymon Doane was given 11,606 votes for only 3.1% of the total votes. 
-Diana DeGette won the election with 272,892 votes.

**Election-Audit Summary**

We could potentially use this same script to make similar projections in elections if the CSV sheet is foramtted similarly or else there may be some tweaking needed with this script. We could also use this script to find percentages and a tally of the number of times a phrase or name comes up. In this module we basically used a for loop to count the number of times a candidates name came up and tracked it to count total votes for that candidate. Similar experiements can be done with minor tweaking.
